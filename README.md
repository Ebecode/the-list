# the-list
A tutorial-less take on the far too popular project. I just had to try it.

Ok, so this is a To-Do list app. I made it responsive. You can add tasks, remove them, or mark them as completed. You can also filter out all completed tasks to shorten the list, or clear the list, removing all items.

How to use the list:
  To add tasks:
  
    - Type in the task you wish to add.
    
    - Click on the "+" button or press "Enter" key.
    
    - The task will be added to the list.
    
    - To mark a task as completed, you can click the check icon on the left of your list item.
    This will highlight it green. If you wish to undo this, click the check icon again.
    
    
   To remove tasks:
   
    - To remove an item from the list, click on the x icon located on the right side of the list item.
    
    - To remove all completed tasks from the list, click on the "filter" button located on the left side
    of the app's footer section.
    
    - To remove all of the list items, click the "Clear" button, located to the right within the footer.
